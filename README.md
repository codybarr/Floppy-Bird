A mobile game by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple
but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping
the screen, making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly.
A variant of popular games like "Helicopter Game" that floated around the internet
for years prior. Illustrates some of the most basic procedural generation of game
levels possible as by having pipes stick out of the ground by varying amounts, acting
as an infinitely generated obstacle course for the player.

# Credits

Much of the code here comes from CS50's Intro to Game development course.

I've added increasingly difficult pipe gaps, some of my own image/sound assets,
a pause feature, reward trophies, and mobile/touch support.
